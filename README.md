# Chest-X-Ray-Images-Pneumonia-
An intelligent system capable of detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images

This project aims to develop an intelligent system capable of detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Pneumonia is particularly challenging to diagnose accurately using traditional methods. Therefore, an automated and reliable detection system could improve diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes.

This project will utilize the dataset available on [Kaggle Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/code), which contains chest X-ray images classified into two categories: Normal and Pneumonia. The primary objectives of this project are to explore and preprocess this dataset, develop detection algorithms using both classical machine learning and neural network techniques, and evaluate the performance of these algorithms.

The workflow of the project is structured as follows:
1. Data Exploration: The dataset will be explored to understand the distribution and characteristics of the images.
2. Data Visualization and Preprocessing: Visualization techniques will be employed to gain insights into the dataset. Preprocessing steps, such as augmentation, and features extraction will be applied to prepare the images for algorithm development.
3. Algorithm Development: \
Classical Machine Learning Techniques: Features will be extracted from the images, and classical machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests, will be employed for pneumonia detection. \
Neural Network Architecture: We will explore a range of neural network models, starting with simple networks and progressing to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning approaches. This will allow us to assess the effectiveness and advantages of each model compared to classical machine learning techniques.

4. Results Presentation: The performance of the developed algorithms will be evaluated using metrics such as confusion matrix. These results will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of each approach in detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. For evaluating models that detect pneumonia from medical images, we focus on four critical metrics:
* Recall for Pneumonia: Measures how well the model identifies pneumonia cases. High recall is essential to avoid missing actual pneumonia patients.
* Precision for Normal: Assesses how accurately the model identifies normal cases. High precision reduces false positives, ensuring healthy individuals are correctly classified.
* Overall Accuracy: Provides a general measure of how often the model is correct. It gives a broad view but can be misleading in imbalanced datasets.
* F1-Score: Balances precision and recall, offering a single metric to gauge the model's effectiveness in both identifying pneumonia and avoiding false positives.

By completing this project, we aim to provide a comparative analysis of different techniques for pneumonia detection.
